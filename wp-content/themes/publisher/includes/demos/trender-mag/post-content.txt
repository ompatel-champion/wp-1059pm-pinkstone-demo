If you’re familiar with Brené Brown, you’re might be wondering what a book about vulnerability has to do with this question. Before taking action, you’ll want to explore.

The other is that people genuinely don’t have confidence in the vision for your company. Whatever the reason, as a member of HR this will likely be a sensitive conversation to have with your leadership.

Based on his extensive experience consulting with Google and other top-tier organizations, venture capitalist John Doer (Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers) shares a roadmap for how to build OKRs (Objectives &amp; Key Results) to create that alignment from top-to-bottom and bottom-to-top.

Sometimes leaders get so caught up in ambitious goals and condensed timing that they forget that people are, well, people.

Even if you’re familiar with Sinek’s work, this is a skill that’s easier said than done. The book provides a clean and simple framework that you can share with the rest of your team.
